     <h2>Kuumba Lynx</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.kuumbalynx.org">Kuumba Lynx</a> was founded on the belief that youth in our society grow up lacking the attention and respect they need to love, understand, and respect themselves and each other.  KL programming focuses on counterculture ideologies and urban culture.  The KL experience fosters an increase in a participant's self discovery of ones voice, self-confidence, expands their world view, and leaves them inspired to continue using art as a means of personal and social expression and community activism.</p>

     <h2>YCA</h2>

      <p><a href="http://youngchicagoauthors.org/blog/">YCA</a> (Young Chicago Authors) was founded in 1991 by Dr. Robert S. Boone. He assembled a group of educators, writers and philanthropists who all believed that young people should have more exposure to creative writing. YCA started as an intensive three-year Saturday program for students who had demonstrated a strong interest in creative writing.</p>
